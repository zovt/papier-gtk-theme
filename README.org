* Papier Theme
[[https://github.com/zovt/papier-gtk-theme][Papier]] is a modification of the [[http://snwh.org/paper/][Paper]] theme originally developed by snwh. Papier seeks to be a lighter, more colourful theme.

** Preamble
While the original theme is focused on providing assets and files for a bunch of major desktop environments, this theme is focused on GNOME 3.16 and onwards.

*** Using the Source
Necessities to edit the assets:

 * inkscape
 * python3

To render new assets from their source SVG files, run the following:

    ./render-gtk3-assets.py
    ./render-gtk3-assets-hidpi.py
    ./render-gnome-shell-assets.py
    ./render-wm-assets.py

Note that these are not my scripts and I have no idea how they work :)

If scripts are throwing errors, they may not be executable, try:
	
	chmod +x *

Each script will look in the asset source directories (../src/*) and render the respective assets (provided there are changes) to the appropriate locations.
